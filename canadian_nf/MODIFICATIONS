All tables:
- The original table data files are unchanged, but because during data import MySQL cannot handle trailing spaces and Oracle cannot handle trailing line feed characters (^M), the original "data/<table>.txt" files were copied to "data/<table>.txt.trimmed" files and processed further to remove all trailing whitespace on every line and empty lines altogether.
- The documentation does not mention what columns can be null, so assuming all columns cannot be null, here are the modifications made:

FOOD_NM:
- Allow COUNTRY_C to be null as not all records specify a value
- Allow FD_DT_PUB to be null as not all records specify a value
- Allow SCI_NM to be null as not all records specify a value
- (MySQL) Change FD_ID size from 11 to 8 to prevent an error with MySQL which requires the size of foreign keyed column to be the same as the referenced column:
  120919  8:37:12 Error in foreign key constraint of table canadian_nf/#sql-5f1_68:
  foreign key (FD_ID) references FOOD_NM(FD_ID):
  Cannot find an index in the referenced table where the
  referenced columns appear as the first columns, or column types
  in the table and the referenced table do not match for constraint.
- (MySQL) Change FD_SRC_ID size from 11 to 2 to prevent an error with MySQL which requires the size of foreign keyed column to be the same as the referenced column:
  120918 23:08:28 Error in foreign key constraint of table canadian_nf/#sql-5f1_5f:
  foreign key (FD_SRC_ID) references FOOD_SRC(FD_SRC_ID):
  Cannot find an index in the referenced table where the
  referenced columns appear as the first columns, or column types
  in the table and the referenced table do not match for constraint.
- (MySQL) Some lines in the data file have a trailing space, which causes problems with MySQL, e.g.
  182$182$2$0$"SPICES, CUMIN SEED"$"ÉPICES, CUMIN, GRAINES"$"Spices, cumin seed"$"Épices, cumin, graines"$"02014"$01/01/1981$$"Cuminum cyminum" 
  There are no ways around this other than pre-processing the file.

NT_AMT:
- Allow STD_ERR to be null as not all records specify a value
- Allow NUM_OBS to be null as not all records specify a value
- Allow NT_VALUE to be null as not all records specify a value

CONV_FAC:
- Allow CONV_FAC to be null as not all records specify a value

YIELD:
- Allow YLD_AMT to be null as not all records specify a value

NT_NM:
- Allow TAGNAME to be null as not all records specify a value
- Set #records to 150 as there are 151 lines inside of NT_NM.txt (150 records + 1 header line), but "wc" says there are 150 lines.
